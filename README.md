# media_storage_tool
 Storing media and docs.
 This tool aims to achieve selective upload functionality based on file type as given by the user. As the user provides certain 
 file types, they are classified according to the file type and then either send to Google Drive storage or AWS S3 bucket.
 The user can also customise which file types they want to send to which location.
